# HomeKit Applications

This plugin has been tested on **iOS 14** with the following HomeKit apps:

- Apple's Home app
- Nearly all 3rd party apps like Elgato Eve

Compatible **Homebridge** version:

- [Homebridge v1.3.0+](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

**Note:** Apple's Home app does not support custom services/characteristics extensions - as such not all functionality is available there. You can still use the Home app with limitations and use other apps to set up the rules and scenes for you.

*Other apps might work, but I can't test them all. If you're using an app that's not listed write me an issue to update the documentation accordingly.*
